# Overview

The purpose of this program is to record personal expenses and keep track of them. It currently handles grocery and restaurant expenses. I am seeking to experiment with Java as I am new to this language. In this version I have used object oriented programming, experimenting with variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, ArrayLists, and inheritance.
